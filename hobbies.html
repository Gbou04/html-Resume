<h1>My Hobbies</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Climbing</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Went indoor and outdoor climbing for the first 
            time when I lived in Norway last year and it 
            was one of the best experiences ever. Every 
            weekend I went to a new mountain to challenge
             myself with different levels of challenge.</li>
    </ul>
<li>Traveling</li>
    <ul>
        <li>I've had the opportunity to travel to different 
            countries and experience new cultures ever since
            I was a little kid. Getting on a plane and flying
            a new destination is my favorite feeling in the world.</li>

<li>Fashion</li>
    <ul>
        <li>In the last two years, I grew more and more in love
            with the trying out new styles as well as expanding
            my knowldge on different brands. I get a lot of my 
            inspiration from TikTok and other various social 
            media platforms.

<li>Photoshoots</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Recently I have been becoming more condifent in myself
            which made me have an interest for modelling and photoshoots.
            I love putting on a nice outfit and going into the city with 
            friends to take pictures.
